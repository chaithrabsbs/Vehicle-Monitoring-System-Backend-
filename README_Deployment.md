Deployment Instruction for Vehicle API .NET Core Application

### Deploy to IIS Server
1.Preparation:

Before deploying your VehicleStatusTracker API, ensure you have the following in place:

Source Code Management :
Ensure that your application's source code is managed using a version control system like Git.

A target server or hosting environment (e.g., Azure, AWS, a dedicated server).

A build of your .NET Core application ready for deployment. You can create a publish build using the dotnet publish command.

2.Create a Deployment Package:

You need to create a deployment package for your .NET Core application. This typically involves copying the build artifacts and relevant files into a package

3.Upload Application:

Depending on your deployment method:

Manual Upload: Copy the published application files to your server.

CI/CD Pipeline: If you are using a CI/CD pipeline, configure it to deploy your application to the target server.

4.Deploy to IIS:

You will need to use deployment tools or scripts to deploy the deployment package to your IIS server. Common tools include PowerShell, Web Deploy (MSDeploy), or custom deployment scripts.

5. Configure IIS:

Ensure that IIS is set up correctly to host your .NET Core application. This may involve configuring application pools, setting up bindings (HTTP or HTTPS), and enabling the .NET Core Hosting Bundle on the server if it's not already installed.
Step 5: Configure IIS Web Application:

Create a new website or web application in IIS for your .NET Core application.
Set the physical path to the location where you deployed the deployment package.

6.Configure Application Pool:

Ensure that the application pool for your application is using the correct .NET Core version (e.g., .NET Core 6 or .NET 5).
You may also need to configure the identity under which the application pool runs.


7.Database Configuration:

If your application uses a database, ensure that the database connection string is correctly configured for the production environment. You might need to update the connection string in your appsettings.json or an environment variable.

8.Secure Secrets:

For sensitive information like API keys or secrets, use a configuration system (like Azure Key Vault) to secure them. Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in configuration files.


9.Security and Permissions:

Ensure that the required permissions are set up for your application to read/write files, access databases, etc.

10.Testing:

Test the deployment by accessing your application through a web browser.

11.Monitoring:

Monitor logging to keep track of your application's performance and health.

12.Rollback Plan:

Prepare a rollback plan in case anything goes wrong during the deployment. This should include a backup of the previous version of your application.
